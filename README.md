# This Python project is a text-based "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where a player competes against the computer:

### User Interaction: The program asks the user to enter their name and then choose "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
### Computer Choice: The computer randomly selects an option (using random.randrange).
### Winner Determination: Based on the user and computer choices, the program determines and displays the winner.
## Play Again Option: After each round, the user can choose to play again, which restarts the game.
The project demonstrates basic control flow, random selection, and recursion in Python.
